# Fault-Identification-Paper
Paper presents a model artificial neural network based on a proposed pyramid model to identify fault type and fault location in an IEEE 33-bus system.
 The operation of the distribution grids is constantly being threatened by occurrence of faults. These
 faults are unpredictable and dangerous. Moreover, the introduction of distributed generations (DGs)
 in modern distribution networks has made the detection of these faults more complicated. Thus, to
 maintain the continuity of the power supply, a fast and accurate fault detection strategy is required
 to isolate the fault. In view of this, the paper presents a data driven fault detection approach with an
 ensemble classifier based smart meter in modern distribution system. To achieve this, a random forest
 (RF) based fault detection algorithm is programmed within the smart meter. At first, the magnitude of
 maximum angular difference between positive and zero sequence component of the current at the DG
 bus is computed. The computed value is then fed to a trained RF classifier for detecting fault conditions.
 The greatest advantage of the proposed algorithm is the non-requisite of additional hardware or
 software kit for fault detection. The algorithm undergoes several test conditions to showcase its
 effectiveness. The algorithm depicts a high accuracy of 98.95%. The results signify that the algorithm
 is robust, reliable and accurate with an additional benefit of augmenting situational awareness.
